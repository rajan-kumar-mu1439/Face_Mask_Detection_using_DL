<h1>Face Mask Detection System using Deep Learning (CNN)</h1>

**👉Summary:**

A deep learning–based computer vision system that automatically detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using facial images.

🔍 Overview

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify facial images into two categories: With Mask and Without Mask.

The model is trained on labeled image data, preprocessed for consistency, and evaluated for real-world usability.

✅ With Mask
